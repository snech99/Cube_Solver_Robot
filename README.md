# Cube_Solver_Robot

This work was created as part of a project in my mechatronics course at Hochschule Wismar, University of Applied Sciences: Technology, Business and Design. 
I worked on it together with a friend of mine. 
It's a Robot which can scan and solve a Rubik's Cube. The Cube needs to be modified with some Magnets on each side so it can be turned by the motors. 
Also, it's possible to take out the Cube and twitch it by yourself. If you don't want to twist it by yourself, we have a mode which will turn it for you randomly with 20 moves.

The Robot have two modes: Automatic and external
Those modes are explained in a special PDF which you can find in the Repo.
Following is a picture of the State_Maschine:
